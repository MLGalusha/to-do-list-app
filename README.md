# To-Do List App

## About This Project

This isn't just another to-do list—it's a **daily coding challenge**. I'm rebuilding this app **from scratch** every day to sharpen my skills in **React, TypeScript, UI development, and clean state management**. Each time I rebuild it, I focus on improving speed, structure, and efficiency.

The goal? **Master React & TypeScript** through real hands-on work, not just tutorials.

## What I'm Practicing Every Day

### Core Features I Rebuild & Improve:

✔️ **State Management** – Handling tasks efficiently with `useState`

✔️ **Component Structure** – Breaking down the UI into reusable parts

✔️ **Props & Event Handling** – Passing data cleanly between components

✔️ **Sorting & Filtering** – Allowing users to organize tasks effectively

✔️ **Local Storage** – Saving tasks so they persist across page refreshes

✔️ **Styling & UI Improvements** – Making sure the app is visually polished

## Why I'm Doing This

🔹 **Speed & Efficiency** – Each rebuild makes me faster at structuring and coding real-world React apps.

🔹 **Deep Understanding** – Instead of memorizing solutions, I learn how things truly work by **rebuilding and refining**.

🔹 **Debugging & Problem-Solving** – Every bug I fix makes me better at understanding how React handles state and re-renders.

🔹 **Portfolio Readiness** – This project will evolve into a clean, well-structured app that showcases my ability to build solid frontend applications.

## What's Next?

**Grocery List App** – Expanding my knowledge by integrating an **API for real-time pricing** and handling **more complex state**.

**AI-Enhanced Features** – Eventually, I'll experiment with integrating **AI-based suggestions or automation** to make task management smarter.
