# To-Do List App

![Demo GIF](./src/assets/app-example.gif)

## Overview

This is my first full-scale project—a to-do list application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. The app leverages advanced **CSS animations** and **transitions** to create engaging, dynamic UI effects as tasks are added, edited, completed, or filtered. Although it’s a to-do list (a common beginner project), I’ve pushed it far beyond the basics to explore a wide range of skills and techniques.

## Project Status

As of now, the app is feature-complete in its core functionality but remains a work-in-progress regarding some stylistic and animation refinements. I have decided to pause further development on this project after an intensive week of work. This pause is deliberate—I’m moving on to work on a wider range of projects to continue growing my skills. Should I return to it in the future, my planned improvements include:

- **Styling Enhancements:**
  - Refining the filter and sort button designs.
  - Improving the styling and animations for the delete and edit buttons, as well as the edit input.
- **Animation Refinements:**
  - Fixing an occasional flicker issue during task state transitions.
  - Smoothing out the search animation for when tasks appear and disappear based on the query.

## Features

- **Task Management:**
  Create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete with smooth transitions.

- **Advanced Animations:**
  Utilizes CSS keyframes, transforms, and dynamic state changes to animate tasks (e.g., sliding rectangles and dripping effects) as they transition between states.

- **Responsive UI:**
  Built with modern CSS techniques (flexbox, grid, transitions) for a dynamic and engaging interface.

- **Search Functionality:**
  Animated filtering of tasks based on search queries.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I restarted the app **four times**. This wasn’t because I disliked it, but because I wanted to refine my understanding of the following:

- **React & TypeScript:**
  Mastering component-based design, state management, and React hooks such as `useEffect` with timeouts.

- **CSS Mastery:**
  Developing advanced animations using keyframes, transitions, and dynamic CSS variables. Debugging layout and animation issues taught me a great deal about browser rendering and styling specificity.

- **Iterative Development:**
  Embracing the cycle of build → test → refactor. Each restart provided the opportunity to reinforce best practices and solidify my coding skills.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the UI components.
- **TypeScript:** To add type safety and improve code maintainability.
- **CSS:** For styling, including advanced animations and transitions.

## Future Improvements

If I decide to revisit this project, potential enhancements include:

- **Polished UI Elements:**
  Further refining the design of filter, sort, delete, and edit buttons.

- **Animation Smoothness:**
  Resolving the occasional flicker during state transitions and enhancing the search animation.

- **Feature Expansion:**
  Possibly integrating additional functionality like user authentication, persistent storage, or enhanced task categorization.

## Conclusion

While this to-do list app might seem like a “beginner project” on the surface, it has been a significant learning journey. I’ve incorporated a wide range of skills from front-end development and design. The project reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and learning by iterating and refining even after multiple restarts. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited to apply these skills to new challenges.
